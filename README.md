# Overview of the Project

### Project: WEATHER APPLICATION
- The MERN Stack Weather Application is a web-based weather forecasting tool that allows users to check current weather conditions and future forecasts for any location worldwide.
- Built using React (Vite), Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and the OpenWeatherMap API, the application provides real-time data updates, customizable UI themes, and location-based services.

- The frontend is designed with a clean and intuitive UI, offering users detailed weather information with dynamic icons and responsive layouts.
- The backend efficiently handles API requests, user preferences, and data storage to optimize the overall experience.
- The application is ideal for users looking for a reliable and visually engaging way to track weather updates on the go.

### Objective

- The goal of this MERN stack Weather Application is to provide users with real-time and forecasted weather updates based on their location or searched cities.
- The application will leverage the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch accurate weather data and display it in a user-friendly interface. Key features include live temperature updates, humidity, wind speed, and extended forecasts.
- The application aims to deliver a seamless and interactive weather-tracking experience with a modern UI and optimized backend performance.

### Key Activities:

**Project Setup & Environment Configuration:**
- Set up the project structure using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
- Configure Vite for a fast React development environment.
- Set up version control using Git/GitHub.
  
**Backend Development:**
- Develop REST APIs to handle user requests and data fetching.
- Implement location-based weather retrieval using IP geolocation.
- Set up MongoDB to store user preferences (favorite cities, temperature units, etc.).
- Optimize API responses for fast and efficient data retrieval.

**Frontend Development:**
- Design a responsive UI with a modern weather-themed layout.
- Implement search functionality for users to find weather details by city or location.
- Integrate OpenWeatherMap API for fetching real-time weather data.
- Display key weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- Implement dark mode/light mode for better user experience.
  
**API Integration & Data Handling:**
- Fetch real-time and forecasted weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.
- Handle API rate limits and errors effectively.
- Convert temperature units between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
  
**User Authentication & Preferences:**
